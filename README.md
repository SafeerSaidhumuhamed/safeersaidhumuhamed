## 🚀 About Me

I turn **messy, real-world data** into insights you can actually use.  
From predicting student dropout rates to exploring smoking’s impact on health, I love projects that combine **technical depth** with **real-world impact**.

> Data is only powerful when it’s understood — my goal is to make that happen.
